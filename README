# Abiotic Factor Interactive Map

This app is a pet project of mine that I have worked on for the past month or so. The idea behind it is to be an interactive map software that you can edit yourself to have the things you wish. You should also be able to share the files with friends or people online so that others can view and use your map data.

This project is by all means not finished, but it is in somewhat working condition right now.

## Features

- Interactive map viewing and editing
- Custom marker placement and management
- Preset item categories from the Abiotic Factor wiki
- Infobox customization with image support
- Map folder organization system
- Data sharing capabilities
- Pinning system for markers and infoboxes

## Installation and Running

This should be as simple as going to [Releases](https://github.com/ComradeAleks/Abiotic-Factor-Interactive-maps/releases/tag/v1.0.0) and downloading the newest release. Then unzip it and run the exe file.

### Requirements

- Obviously a windows computer

## Data Folder and Files

All items from the wiki (from the last time I copied it all) should be within the folder `data/presets/` (whatever category or subcategory it is). You can of course change and add as many items as you want, but they all follow (for now) the same simple format (go check it out if you're interested). They are all written in a txt file, but in JSON format for my own view of simplicity.

### Important Files

The interesting files are within `data/app-data`, where you can find:

1. **pinned.txt** - All pinned infoboxes or markers
2. **maps** - Map data and configuration folder

Within the maps folder, you will find that some maps are placed into folders with other maps. This is to create the system where you can organize the maps together.

You should be able to add, remove, or move around folders, creating your own maps or map folders.

### Map Loading Order

If you want a certain load order for the maps, that can be changed within the `maps-loading-order.json` file.

### Map Folder Structure

When you enter a map folder, you will see it can contain 4 things:

1. **images folder** - This is for images you upload to infoboxes if you want that
2. **item-details.json** - This is where you find all edited infoboxes and their data
3. **markers.txt** - This is a txt file with JSON format where every marker on the map is located
4. **[mapname].png/.jpg** - The map image (changing the image obviously will change the map in the app)
